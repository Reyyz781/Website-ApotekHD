Project Summary
The Apotek Hade project is a modern web application designed for an online pharmacy. It provides users with an intuitive interface for browsing and purchasing medications, featuring a comprehensive catalog, shopping cart functionality, and a streamlined checkout process. The platform aims to enhance the shopping experience by integrating features typically found in a physical pharmacy, such as inventory management and customer notifications.

Project Module Description

Medicine Catalog: Displays a list of available medicines with search and filter capabilities.
Shopping Cart: Allows users to add, remove, and adjust quantities of items before checkout.
Checkout Process: Facilitates user data entry and order confirmation, generating a receipt upon successful purchase.
User Interface Components: Custom UI components for enhanced user experience.
